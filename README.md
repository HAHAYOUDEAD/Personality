# Features
- Dynamic outfit option that changes your character's clothes based on some condition (indoors/outdoors/injured)
- All character textures are easily replacible. Check included "personality" folder for some readmes
- Barebones option to tint hands texture

# Installation
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) if it's your first mod

Get the latest [release](https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/Personality/releases) and extract into `.../Mods/`

Requires [ModSettings](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings/releases) (also just drop it's .dll into `.../Mods/`)

# Possible upcoming features
- Make compatible with mods that use custom arms (Pastime Reading, Binoculars)
- Custom trinkets (for example bracelet for Astrid and watch for Will)
- Dynamic paperdolls (showing injures, fatigue and probably something else)
- 2 new characters. They are done conceptually, I would need to add the clothes, proper first person models and paperdolls. So it might take a while
- Framework for adding all the clothes is there, so I probably will very gradually add the clothes in form of updates
